# Player Presence System Fix

## Issue Description
The original implementation had a problem where player names would remain in the waiting room even after players left the game. This happened because:

1. **Unreliable cleanup**: The system relied only on the `beforeunload` event to remove players, which doesn't work reliably (especially on mobile)
2. **No presence detection**: There was no way to detect when players became inactive
3. **Duplicate entries**: Players could rejoin and create duplicate entries

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Heartbeat System
- Players now send a "heartbeat" signal every 5 seconds to indicate they're still active
- A `last_active` timestamp is stored and updated for each player
- Players are automatically removed if they haven't sent a heartbeat for 15+ seconds

### 2. Improved Cleanup
- **Multiple cleanup triggers**: `beforeunload`, manual leave, page visibility changes
- **Automatic inactive player cleanup**: Host runs cleanup every 8 seconds
- **Duplicate prevention**: Existing players with the same name are removed before adding new ones

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Graceful handling of network issues
- Fallback polling system (every 3 seconds) for real-time subscription failures

## Files Modified

### 1. `supabase-config.js`
- Added `last_active` column support
- New functions: `removePlayerByName()`, `updatePlayerHeartbeat()`, `cleanupInactivePlayers()`
- Improved duplicate handling in `addPlayer()`

### 2. `player-online.html`
- Added heartbeat system that sends updates every 10 seconds
- Improved cleanup on page unload and navigation
- Better error handling for network issues

### 3. `host-online.html`
- Added automatic cleanup of inactive players every 15 seconds
- Improved player list refresh logic

### 4. `supabase-schema.sql`
- Added `last_active` column to `players` table
- Added database index for performance optimization

## Installation/Update Instructions

### For New Installations
1. Run the updated `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. Deploy the updated HTML and JS files

### For Existing Installations
1. **Update Database Schema**: Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_active TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW();
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_players_last_active ON players(last_active);
   ```

2. **Update Code Files**: Replace your existing files with the updated versions:
   - `supabase-config.js`
   - `player-online.html`
   - `host-online.html`

3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Have users refresh their browsers to get the updated code

## How It Works

### Player Side
1. When a player joins, they start sending heartbeats every 5 seconds
2. If they close the tab/browser, navigate away, or lose internet, heartbeats stop
3. Multiple cleanup mechanisms ensure the player is removed from the database

### Host Side
1. Displays players from the database in real-time
2. Every 8 seconds, removes players who haven't been active for 15+ seconds
3. Updates the player list whenever database changes are detected

### Database
- Stores `last_active` timestamp for each player
- Automatic cleanup removes inactive players
- Prevents duplicate player names in the same game

## Testing the Fix

1. **Join a game** with a player device
2. **Close the browser tab** without clicking "Leave the room"
3. **Wait 15-25 seconds** and check the host screen
4. **The player should disappear** from the waiting room

## Benefits

- ✅ **Fast player tracking**: Players are removed within 15-25 seconds of becoming inactive
- ✅ **Mobile-friendly**: Works even when mobile browsers don't fire `beforeunload` events
- ✅ **Network resilient**: Handles poor internet connections gracefully
- ✅ **No duplicates**: Prevents the same player name from appearing multiple times
- ✅ **Real-time updates**: Host sees changes immediately when players join/leave
- ✅ **Performance optimized**: Database queries are efficient with proper indexing

## Monitoring

To monitor the system:
- Check browser console for heartbeat and cleanup messages
- Monitor Supabase real-time logs for player additions/removals
- The host console will show "Cleaned up inactive players" every 8 seconds

## Troubleshooting

If players still don't disappear:
1. Check that the `last_active` column was added to your database
2. Verify that real-time subscriptions are working in Supabase
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Ensure the Supabase configuration is correct
